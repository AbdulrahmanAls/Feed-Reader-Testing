# Feed Reader Testing

In this project I made test driven in [Feedreader](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) by using [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction) 

## The test I do 
1.RSS Feeds
- are defined
- URL defined and not empty
- The name is defined and not empty
2. The menu
- hidden by default
- menu changes
3. Initial Entries
- test that ensures when the loadFeed
4. New Feed Selection
- A new feed is loaded
